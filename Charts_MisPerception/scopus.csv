It is based on a comparative expert assessment carried out in the frame of the Horizon 2020 project WinWind covering six European countries. The focus of the paper is on procedural and financial participation of citizens and local stakeholders in wind energy projects. The first part covers institutional arrangements for public engagement in two areas of the decision-making process-wind turbine zoning/siting in spatial plans and authorization procedures. Here, three levels of public involvement-information, consultation and participation-were analyzed. The second part examines active and financial participation of citizens and local stakeholders. Here, we distinguish between two different modes of governance: institutionalized forms of public governance and voluntary forms of corporate governance. The outcomes suggest that concrete paths to the social acceptance of wind energy are fostered via appropriate institutional spaces for public engagement. Furthermore, missing opportunities for active and passive financial participation can have strong negative consequences for community acceptance. © 2020 by the authors.

This review compares the adaptation of policies introduced by Germany, Denmark, the United Kingdom, and Ireland to investigate how the roles of community stakeholders interconnect with the European Union's commitment to accelerate onshore wind deployment. These mature markets view onshore wind energy as an essential contribution towards the net-zero electricity system, security of supply, and energy independence. The comparative case study highlights that the interaction between market-based and community-based approaches to wind energy development has seen the size, scale and formality of financial benefits increase while supports for small-scale community-led wind energy have been considerably reduced. The continued paradigm shift narrows the scope for community participation in wind farms and presents considerations and paradoxes regarding the role of communities in local energy transitions. Recommendations consider the need for flexibility regarding the geographic “proximity criteria” for citizen participation, approaches to include communities into the governance and disbursement of shared benefits, and the potential to encourage citizen investment into onshore wind energy. These contribute to the debate regarding the balance between objectives of the energy transition: to promote meaningful citizen participation and benefit at a local scale while rapidly reducing the levelized cost of renewable energy for the wider benefit of society. © 2024 The Author"",""Financial benefits"; Investment; Social acceptance; Sustainable development;" Wind energy"","""",""Review"",""Final"",""All Open Access";" Hybrid Gold Open Access"",""Scopus"",""2-s2.0-85195022003""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In 2040, electricity production from wind turbines could reach four times the current level. In the case of photovoltaic systems, around seven to eight times the current level is possible. Only in the area of biomass has the expansion potential already been largely exhausted. The building sector can also contribute to achieving climate neutrality. If the renovation rate is significantly increased to 3.3% per year by 2040, the required heating energy can be reduced by around 60%. At the same time, these energy transition scenarios are evaluated with regard to their regional economic opportunities for Lusatia. In an ambitious climate neutrality scenario, around 450 million euros in regional added value can be generated in 2040 and around 3560 full-time jobs can be filled. In order for this to succeed, however, the citizens and municipalities must first be given more opportunities for financial participation through appropriate framework conditions at federal and state level. We see financial benefits for the population and the municipalities as a critical success factor in order to be able to provide the necessary space, initiate investments and ultimately contribute to local acceptance. © The Author(s) 2024."",""Climate neutrality"; Energy transition; Financial participation; Regional economic analysis;" Renewable energies"","""",""Article"",""Final"",""All Open Access";" Hybrid Gold Open Access"",""Scopus"",""2-s2.0-85183737205""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Offering some form of involvement to the affected communities may reduce objections and minimise project delays. We carry out a nationally-representative survey of Irish citizens to analyse how different involvement methods affect acceptance. Ireland is a useful case study because of its high RES-E targets. Survey respondents are presented with four involvement models for the local construction of a wind farm, and two for the local development of the transmission grid. We find a preference for schemes in which people receive financial compensation without sharing in the ownership and associated risks of project development. Our econometric analyses show that socio-demographic characteristics such as age and income are significant predictors of people's acceptance under different schemes. Moreover, we find that the satisfaction with local planning procedures and the trade-off people make between environmental sustainability and economic competitiveness are consistently associated with people's attitudes. Such evidence can help policy makers better understand and design policies to minimise resistance to energy infrastructure development. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."",""Community compensation"; Community involvement; Grid expansion; Renewable energy;" Social acceptance"",""Ireland"; alternative energy; compensation system; competitiveness; construction; ecological economics; infrastructural development; local participation; local planning; model; public attitude; smart grid; socioeconomic conditions; sustainability; trade-off;" wind farm"",""Article"",""Final"",""All Open Access";" Green Open Access"",""Scopus"",""2-s2.0-85040766629""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Unfortunately, the largest part of new scheduled installations is concentrated in a few geographical regions, in an attempt to take advantage of the existing electrical network capabilities and the acceptable infrastructure situation. This significant concentration of very large size wind turbines, rapidly installed in a few geographical areas, led to serious reactions from the local population, which in some cases even led to the complete cancellation of the wind power projects. In this context, an extensive study is conducted, concerning the public attitude towards wind energy applications, in several island and mainland Greek territories possessing high wind potential and investment interest. The results obtained significantly reveal acceptance of the existing wind parks, being, however, rather against new installations. More specifically, in the Greek islands the public attitude is clearly supportive, while in the Greek mainland the public attitude is either divided or definitely against wind power applications. The most troublesome outcome of this survey is the existence of a specific minority that is strongly against wind energy applications, disregarding any financial benefits.

This often causes project delays or even failure. Financial benefits may be one way to counteract a lack of community support. This analysis seeks to explain how discounted electricity, payments to the municipality, and payments for social purposes shift the acceptance of communities about a local wind energy project. A choice-based conjoint analysis among 811 German citizens showed that financial benefits increase citizens’ acceptance of a hypothetical wind energy project in the close vicinity of their homes. Proponents and the large group of citizens with rather weak preferences for local wind energy projects appreciate all tested benefits. In contrast, benefits cannot win over the small group of opponents. The study provides evidence that benefits do not ensure the perception of fair distributive justice, even for citizens with weak preferences.

This research considers how residents’ perceptions of the benefits and negative impacts of wind turbines shift post-construction by surveying the same individuals (n = 520) at two time periods after a nearby wind project became operational. We find that residents’ perceptions follow two separate trajectories based on their perception of the fairness of the wind siting planning process and—to a lesser extent—whether they have a direct financial stake in the wind project. Residents who perceived a fair planning process tended to perceive greater benefits of wind turbines, job creation, and revenues for landowners specifically, while residents who perceived an unfair process perceived significantly greater negative impacts, including visual and noise problems, reduction of nearby property values, and human health problems. These results suggest that while energy business models that extent direct financial compensation to more landowners impact the attitudes of residents in the short-term, resident attitudes about procedural justice may have implications that extend well beyond the project planning stage, impacting long-term support for adding new and repowering old turbines. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"",""Community acceptance"; Direct compensation; Perceived impacts; Procedural justice;" Wind energy"",""Michigan"; United States; compensation system; landowner; perception; public attitude; social justice;" wind turbine"",""Article"",""Final"","""",""Scopus"",""2-s2.0-85060295597""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This research explores whether the provision of community benefits associates with increased local support for a hypothetical, future offshore wind farm in Exmouth (UK), using an experimental methodology (n = 311). Participants were allocated to one of three framing conditions: (i) a 'no-framed condition', presenting basic information about a possible wind farm without mentioning community benefits"; (ii) a 'community benefit frame', highlighting the likely community benefits that would accompany a wind farm;" or (iii) a 'dual framing' condition, presenting information about community benefits alongside critical perspectives that commonly surround these (perceptions of 'bribery'). Support for the development was greatest under the community benefit frame. However, this heightened support diminished in a context of social contestation (the dual framing condition). Elevated perceptions of collective rather than individual outcome favourability or procedural justice explained why support was greatest under the community benefit frame. Ensuring and communicating that community benefits offer a 'good deal' to communities, rather than focusing on individual benefits, may be the most viable avenue to increase support for renewable energy developments through community benefits. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on quantitative Data on conflicts and participation procedures in the expansion of wind energy in Lower Saxony, the article shows that local conflicts often occur where new wind farms are planned. Repowering or the expansion of existing wind farms is less likely to be accompanied by conflicts. In addition, there seems to be habituation effects. This means that in municipalities where many wind turbines are already in operation, there are fewer conflicts than in municipalities with fewer wind turbines. The multiple correlation analysis shows a clear correlation between the occurrence of local conflicts and the availability of dialogue-oriented and financial participation procedures.

The qualitative case study of three Danish wind energy projects discloses that distributive unfairness was a prevalent concern among local citizens, and that this concern was inseparable from perceptions of procedural fairness and recognition. The key conclusion is that the two compensation schemes are not successfully offsetting perceptions of unfair distribution. The schemes are challenged by a multitude of intertwined concerns. The compensation schemes are not equipped to address the plethora of non-monetary values affected by the wind projects. Specifically the compensation schemes are criticised for not offering adequate local benefits or distribution thereof, equal access, fair procedures and transparency.

Although the benefits of renewable sources of energy represent a compulsory effort towards ensuring sustainable energy strategies for the future, due to the increased pressure of balancing climate change, limitation of traditional energy resources and economic competition, the expansion of wind parks has caused strong reactions of local communities in many regions leading to the reorganization of public exposure strategies of many companies in the field. This research intends to offer a sample of public perceptions of wind turbines depending on several influence factors, based on the answers of 64 Dutch citizens and 40 Romanian respondents. Through the implementation of the Delphi method based on questionnaires and interviews, an overview of perceptions towards placement of wind turbines in the two analyzed countries has been offered, providing significant answers to the influence factors of public reactions for or against wind turbines. The main results of the research revealed the importance of financial benefits in increasing public acceptance of wind farms, as well as several subjective factors, such as the visual impact of wind turbines and onshore or offshore placement, that contribute to a positive or negative behavior of citizens towards it. © 2016, Editura Economica.

Wind farms require hundreds of square miles of land for development and developers typically interact with landowners to lease land for construction and operations. Landowners sign land lease contracts without knowing the turbine layout, which affects aesthetics of property as well as value of the lease contract. Having a turbine placed on one's land is much more lucrative than not, but landowners have to sign over the use of their land without knowing if they will receive this financial benefit or not. The timing of this process, typically referred to as “Landowner Acquisition,” introduces high uncertainty for both stakeholders and represents a major pain point of the industry—a source stated up to 50% of wind projects fail due to landowner acquisition issues. We present an agent-based model that models the land lease contract period with unique decision-making characteristics for a set of landowners and a wind farm developer. Citizen participation is an integral part of community acceptance of wind farms, thus we use principles from past studies to quantify three actions a developer can take to influence landowner decisions: (1) community engagement meetings"; (2) preliminary environmental studies;" and (3) sharing the wind turbine layout with the landowner. The results show how landowner acceptance rates can potentially change over time based on what actions the developer takes. Overall, developers can use this model to better understand interactions with landowners and determine what actions may help positively influence landowner acceptance rates.

Second, using an econometric model, we study how different factors influence social acceptance levels. Our investigation assesses social acceptance of renewable energy developments using primary data from two comprehensive opinion surveys. The first opinion survey -conducted in September/October 2021- contains more than 16 000 observations from 8 European countries and allows us to assess how social acceptance is affected by the distance to the wind parks. The second opinion survey - conducted in June 2022 - contains more than 18 000 observations from 9 European countries and allows us to assess -through an econometric model how social acceptance is affected by a set of relevant influential factors, including perceptions, preferences towards energy suppliers, preferences for community benefits schemes, and demographic factors among others. The analysis of the information gathered for this investigation shows variations across European countries and within each of the countries covered by this study.

However, cases where local people consent to cede land to land investors have not yet received sufficient scholarly attention. Focusing on the Kipeto wind energy project in Kenya, this paper presents a counterpoint to the theoretical postulate of ‘accumulation by dispossession’ – to show how accumulation was possible without community dispossession of land. Grounded in empirical research, the paper argues, first, that land acquisition for wind energy development does not necessarily lead to dispossession if affected populations are compensated fairly, for example with better housing, jobs, money, and importantly are allowed to continue accessing land to sustain livelihoods. Second, the achievability of Kipeto wind energy project is largely due to the company's strategic approach to land consultation and negotiation with communities, which leads to wider social acceptance of the wind energy project. Nevertheless, some landowners have expressed their dissatisfaction concerning the financial compensation mechanisms. Thus, there is need for a longitudinal study to ascertain the extent to which the project developer and landowners keep to their promises as well as to understand the long-term impacts of land deals. © 2024 The Author"",""Accumulation without dispossession"; Kenya; Land acquisition; Livelihoods; Social acceptance;" Wind energy"","""",""Article"",""Final"",""All Open Access";" Hybrid Gold Open Access"",""Scopus"",""2-s2.0-85188696773""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Thus, ideas of distributive economic justice have received traction, particularly in the form of praise for community-based development models. This paper reports on the findings from a mixed-methods study concerning preferred distributive justice elements in rural communities in Ontario (technocratic-based model) and Nova Scotia (community-based model) living with turbines. Residents’ perceptions of economic benefits are nuanced, but unlike other studies, this empirical work shows that both the fair distribution and the amount of local benefits are important predictors of project support.

Coastal communities within the viewshed or hosting transmission cables may fear several impacts but few benefits. Community benefits, provided through the wind farm developer, may help garner local support in communities in close proximity to a wind farm project. This research focused on the first offshore wind energy lease off the coastline of North Carolina, U.S. This study utilized semi-structured interviews to understand how key informants think of a proposed offshore wind farm in the context of community benefits. Findings reveal that key informants are skeptical of direct benefits like local employment, though optimistic about indirect, regional benefits, like economic development. The majority of key informants were interested in a community fund that would be administered by the local government or a trusted local organization. This study provides an initial assessment of perspectives on community benefits in the context of offshore wind development and makes recommendations on how to incorporate community benefits into the offshore wind development process.

The project included, besides two listening tests, a survey of perceptual and socioeconomic factors. In a questionnaire to habitants in the vicinity of the investigated wind farms, questions were asked regarding their housing situation, living conditions, the bedroom's orientation towards wind turbines, noise disturbance, visual impact from wind turbines, economic incentive models, ownership structures, general attitudes about wind power, and more. The purpose was to provide a holistic basis for a future synthesis model for disturbance, and this project focused on the correlation between noise disturbance and visual impact from wind turbines, ownership structures and financial compensation models from the wind farm. The questionnaire was analysed with psychometric methods, including logistic regression and multivariate techniques as principal component regression. The results of the psychometric analyses showed a large spread in sensitivity to disturbances (both visual and acoustic) from wind power plants, but the most difficult elements could be identified for various factors in the questions, including e.g. audial and health factors, and the quality of financial compensation. © INTER-NOISE 2019 MADRID - 48th International Congress and Exhibition on Noise Control Engineering.

By and large, both policy makers and researchers have couched the rationale for community benefits in instrumental terms, i.e. that an increased flow of community benefits will improve the social acceptability of these facilities and thereby expedite planning consent. This paper questions this conventional rationale. Proponents of this rationale neglect the institutionally structured terrain of the planning process"; the provision of community benefits can shift in significance depending on whether or not the 'affected community' has any significant influence over wind farm projects. Similarly, our discourse analysis conducted in Wales shows that community benefits are seen predominantly as compensation for impacts, without any clear implication that they should change social attitudes.

A point of particular interest in this survey is the adverse environmental conditions and poor air quality existing in the area under investigation, resulting from the long-term operation of a lignite-based thermal power station. A postal, three-part survey has been conducted based on a representative sample of local inhabitants. According to the results obtained, high levels of acceptability for existing and new projects have been encountered for all technologies examined. Interestingly, better results concerned PV applications, with the positive trend towards new projects being illustrated by the high percentage of about 85%. Similarly, wind and hydro energy applications demonstrate high acceptability of the order of 80%. Furthermore, local habitants' experience on already operating renewable energy projects in the region has also designated their """" tolerance"""" on the main environmental impacts of these technologies (visual, noise, land occupation etc.). However, this survey also reveals a specific minority of people that are opposed to renewable energy applications, either disregarding any environmental, social and financial benefits or just weighing benefits less heavily than the reasons of opposition. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd."",""Environmental impacts"; Land usage; Noise impact; Questionnaires; Renewable energy sources (RES);" Visual impact"",""Greece"; Air quality; Electric utilities; Environmental impact; Noise pollution; Surveys; Thermoelectric power plants; Wind power; Land usage; Noise impact; Questionnaires; Renewable energy source; Visual impacts; air quality; attitudinal survey; comparative study; decision making; environmental conditions; environmental impact assessment; hydroelectric power; land use change; lignite; perception; photovoltaic system; power plant; public attitude; renewable resource; thermal power; wind farm;" Energy policy"",""Article"",""Final"","""",""Scopus"",""2-s2.0-84869871546"""

Wind farms require hundreds of square miles of land for development and developers typically interact with landowners to lease land for construction and operations. Landowners sign land lease contracts without knowing the turbine layout, which affects aesthetics of property as well as value of the lease contract. Having a turbine placed on one’s land is much more lucrative than alternative land uses, but landowners must sign over the use of their land without knowing whether they will receive this financial benefit or not. This process, typically referred to as “Landowner Acquisition,” is highly uncertain for both stakeholders—a source stated up to 50% of wind projects fail due to landowner acquisition issues. We present an agent-based model to study the landowner acquisition period with unique decision-making characteristics for nine landowners and a developer. Citizen participation is crucial to the acceptance of wind farms";" thus, we use past studies to quantify three actions a developer can take to influence landowners: (1) community engagement meetings, (2) preliminary environmental studies, and (3) sharing the wind turbine layout with the landowner. Results show how landowner acceptance rates can change over time based on what actions the developer takes. While still in the “proof of concept” stage, this model provides a framework for quantifying wind stakeholder interactions and potential developer actions. Suggestions for how to validate the framework in the future are included in the discussion.

They facilitate citizen participation by developing context-specific solutions, which calls for leadership and complex social dynamics. We present an agent-based simulation model to explore the formation of community energy initiatives from the bottom-up, accounting for social networks and evolution of opinions facilitating or hindering LEIs. Our novel model relies on well-established social theories and uses empirical data on community energy systems in the Netherlands and individual citizens’ preferences. Specifically, our computational model captures behavioural drivers and social value orientations, and relates individuals behavioural traits to aggregated stylized facts about energy initiatives at the community level. The results indicate that when communities lack participants with cooperative orientation, altruistic citizens with prosocial social value orientations become essential for the creation of LEIs, revealing different pathways to achieve public good benefits. Our analysis systematically demonstrate that leaders can be a bottleneck in the LEIs’ formation and that an increase in initiators is conducive to the creation of LEIs. Therefore, policies aiming at increasing the number of community initiatives should target small groups and individuals with the leadership potential, who could lead projects, and explore synergies with wider community benefits. © 2020 The Authors"",""Agent-based modelling"; Collective action; Community energy systems; Leadership; Local energy initiatives; Solar;" Wind energy"","""",""Article"",""Final"",""All Open Access"; Green Open Access;" Hybrid Gold Open Access"",""Scopus"",""2-s2.0-85092287854""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The SLO emerged in response to a pressing need for local communities to accept operations relating to the extraction of naturally occurring resources"; the local acceptance of such operations was and remains vital. Naturally occurring resources such as oil and gas are geographically bound, and so the location of the operation depends on the presence of the resource, not on the support of the local population. Further, resource extraction is often highly disruptive and thus the support of the local population may not be easily won. To address this issue, much attention has been devoted to understanding the conditions of local acceptance within the oil and gas industry. As the energy industry diversifies in pursuit of sustainability, many energy companies are seeking to expand their portfolio to renewable sources. Despite their green credentials, new energy projects such as onshore wind farms, nuclear sites, and solar farms often face local opposition. In particular, onshore wind energy faces a significant amount of local resistance (Botetzagias et al., 2015; Horst, 2007) and, in countries such as the UK where local acceptance is required for the approval of new developments, local opposition will have serious implications for the industry. In this chapter, we argue that much can be learned from the experiences of the oil and gas industry and that there are lessons which can be applied to other forms of energy based on naturally occurring resources. This chapter will consider the similarities and differences between the local acceptance challenges faced by the oil and gas industry, and renewable alternatives such as onshore wind. Community engagement and transparency, community benefits, and local content shall all be considered as opportunities for new energy initiatives to gain legitimacy among local communities. Conversely, the experiences of the onshore wind energy industry may offer some useful insights to the oil industry; these insights will also be presented and considered. While there are some concerns regarding the environmental impacts of onshore wind energy (Leung & Yang, 2012;" Phillips, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 49:1261-1270, 2015), it is generally accepted to be a sustainable source of energy. Therefore, where there is local resistance, this is likely not based on sustainability concerns, but on other, more local issues which the developments have failed to address. An improved understanding of what these concerns are may inform the way in which the oil and gas industry approaches challenges of social acceptance. This well be of great value to both the oil industry and the onshore wind energy sector as governments and consumers seek diversified energy portfolios which make the most of our available resources. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerl and AG 2024."","""","""",""Book chapter"",""Final"","""",""Scopus"",""2-s2.0-85206047435""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Despite support from policy-makers and developers for community benefit packages, the relationship between the benefit package and acceptance of renewable energy projects is not straightforward. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with local residents and other community actors near a wind development in central Scotland, this paper examines the ‘process’ and ‘outcome’ dimensions of the design and provision of community benefits, and considers how the relationship between these two dimensions affects local perceptions of the benefit of community benefits. Analysis of interviewees’ perceptions of the community engagement ‘process’ at the planning stage and the community benefit package ‘outcome’ reveals how a poorly defined engagement process, combined with a benefits package that is not deemed suitable for the needs of the community, can lead to negative perceptions of the project, even when these were initially positive. These findings have implications for renewable energy policy in Scotland, particularly as there is currently no legal obligation for developers to consult communities on community benefit arrangements. © 2017 Royal Scottish Geographical Society."",""community benefit"; community energy; community engagement; renewables; Scotland;" wind energy"",""Scotland"; United Kingdom; alternative energy; community organization; energy policy; perception;" wind power"",""Article"",""Final"",""All Open Access";" Green Open Access"",""Scopus"",""2-s2.0-85035102033""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The cultural landscape of buffalos and workers cultivating oyster fields has been recognized as a precious cultural heritage by both local and international parties. However, Fangyuan Township is facing a turning point due to the installation of offshore wind turbines. Development-promoting public agencies and the private sectors are both in need of a new vision of communities in which a viable combination of new, green-energy-based industries and traditional, culture- based industries is allowed to take shape. With that in mind, we reviewed several other localities' experience of green-energy development and its effect on the community. We also analyzed how traditional cultural properties have been incorporated into the tourism industry in Fangyuan Township while also investigating the potential impact of the development of offshore wind farms (OWF) on traditional oyster cultivation there. A series of interviews and meetings with key stakeholders were held to examine, from different points of view, the benefits offered to the community by OWF developers and governmental decision-makers.

However, this Eurocentric and settler-based literature routinely overlooks Indigenous contexts, causing concern that the energy transition might reproduce the socio-economic inequalities of the fossil fuel era. Through 32 semi-structured interviews conducted within a community-based approach, this paper examines the lived experience of people living with wind turbines in M'Chigeeng First Nation in Ontario, an Indigenous community who owns and operates two wind turbines. We examine what the turbines mean to M'Chigeeng members, how owning the turbines relates to the community's values and goals, and to which extent M'Chigeeng's engagement in renewable energy portends a redefinition of relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people in Canada. The key themes in our findings are acceptance and support of the turbines, intra community communication, the importance of ownership, and relationships. While members expressed the need for clear and up-to-date communication on the project and are yet to see the generated financial benefits, intracommunity tensions remain manageable for the time being, tempered by a general pride from owning the turbines. Connecting relationships to restorative justice and recognition justice, we argue that these latter dimensions are equally, if not more meaningful, than procedural and distributional justice for understanding the meaning of turbines in M'Chigeeng First Nation.

We conclude by highlighting a number of avenues of potential future research. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"",""Financial participation"; Longitudinal research; Power dynamics; Renewable energy; Social acceptance;" Wind power"","""",""Editorial"",""Final"","""",""Scopus"",""2-s2.0-85165263390""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

One of these is the wind farm co-ownership scheme, OPSS. In this study, we explore local perceptions of OPSS via survey-data collected during the Danish near-shore bid for tender in 2015 from almost 2000 respondents. Empirical evidence suggests that demographic facts, such as gender and age, influence the general appeal of the scheme, and as engagement in wind-projects via OPSS presupposes investment liquidity, OPSS is not equal for all. Furthermore, most potential OPSS-investors already support the planned wind farm projects, and many project opponents will not engage themselves in something they are against in principle. Finally, economic benefits potentially gained via OPSS do not appear to compensate for values feared violated by wind farms by many wind farm project stakeholders. While OPSS is a very positive policy attempt at creating local engagement via wind farm co-ownership, it is clear that the scheme alone will not adequately compensate for local wind farm related grievances. Real world facts and complications, such as demographics, preconceived project perceptions and personal values, get in the way. Implications of the study for related policies are discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd"",""Community benefits"; Energy policy; Incentive schemes; Renewable energy; Wind farm co-ownership;" Wind farm planning"",""Denmark"; Economics; Electric utilities; Energy policy; Investments; Population statistics; Wind power; Community benefit; Financial incentives; Incentive schemes; Incentive structure; Nearshores; Renewable energies; Survey data; Wind farm; Wind farm co-ownership; Wind farm planning; alternative energy; empirical analysis; energy policy; incentive; local participation; ownership; perception; wind farm; wind power;" Surveys"",""Article"",""Final"","""",""Scopus"",""2-s2.0-85044139748""";;;;;;;

Community benefits are a promising tool to reduce local opposition, as they have proven to do so in wind farm developments. By adding multiple functions to a solar farm, benefits for the local community - other than sustainable energy production - can be generated. However, also examples exist where community benefits have not managed to reduce levels of opposition. Therefore, this research aims to understand the role of community benefits in community acceptance of multifunctional solar farm developments through case studies in the Netherlands. The research consists of two phases: an exploratory phase through desk research mapping multifunctional solar farm developments in the Netherlands and an explanatory phase, analysing why community benefits are implemented and how they affect community acceptance, done through interviews. The results show that a key factor determining if community benefits contribute to community acceptance is the extent to which these benefits meet the experienced needs of a community. The degree to which solar farm developments succeed in meeting these needs depends on the motives and interest of developers to provide benefits, the history and context of the location and the level of community involvement. When the community feels like the benefits meet their needs, community acceptance is increased. However, when the compensation offered does not meet these needs, it negatively influences trust and thus leads to more resistance. © 2022 The Authors"",""Community acceptance"; Community benefits; Community involvement; Land sharing; Multifunctionality;" Solar farm"",""Netherlands"; alternative energy; energy management; local participation; solar power;" wind farm"",""Article"",""Final"",""All Open Access";" Hybrid Gold Open Access"",""Scopus"",""2-s2.0-85137283183""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Both participatory processes and outcomes which recognise local impacts are necessary for the acceptance of onshore wind farms. This paper distinguishes between shared community benefit funds, near-neighbour compensation, and citizen investment relative to issues of ownership, modes of engagement and the management of financial benefits during siting, construction, and operation of a wind farm respectively. Citizens willing to accept place greater importance on factors associated with distributive and procedural justice, while proximity and related visual impacts have comparatively more importance for citizens unwilling to accept. Willingness to accept is associated with early, in-person, engagement with a community liaison officer during siting and citizen participation in the governance and distribution of financial benefits during operation. However, citizens who show conditional support for wind farm developments prefer compensation of near-neighbour households, semi-state developers, and town hall engagement meetings. Strong supporters are more influenced by financial benefits for the wider community and local (co-)ownership of wind farms, particularly joint ventures between the developer and community. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"",""Choice experiment"; Citizen participation; Distributive justice; Financial benefits; Willingness to accept;" Wind energy"",""Ireland"; Economic and social effects; Electric utilities; Farms; Investments; Wind power; Choice experiments; Citizen's participations; Distributive justice; Financial benefits; Ireland; Nearest-neighbour; Onshore winds; Trade off; Willingness to accept; Wind farm; energy management; energy policy; experimental study; financial services; local participation; willingness to pay; wind power;" Decision making"",""Article"",""Final"","""",""Scopus"",""2-s2.0-85143679344""";;;;;;

Ambitious renewable energy targets are requiring investments in new renewable capacity in areas where acceptance could be affected by the potential economic benefits to the locality. At the same time, new renewable energy projects, primarily for onshore wind capacity, might offer a route by which peripheral economic development policies can be supported. The economic impacts of these projects are difficult to quantify using input-output techniques, but can be more appropriately handled within a social accounting matrix (SAM) framework. A social accounting matrix for the Shetland Islands, off the north coast of mainland Scotland, is used to evaluate the potential local economic and employment impacts of a large proposed onshore wind energy project. Sensitivity analysis reveals the relative importance of the level of 'community benefit' payments, 'local sourcing' of intermediate inputs and the level of community ownership of the project to the size of these impacts. In the Shetland case, by a substantial margin, local ownership confers the greatest economic impacts for the local community. © 2011 Regional Studies Association."",""Renewable energy rural economic impacts revenue sharing community ownership"",""Scotland"; Shetland; United Kingdom; alternative energy; economic development; economic impact; economic policy; input-output analysis; local economy; renewable resource; sensitivity analysis; wind power;" wind turbine"",""Article"",""Final"",""All Open Access";" Green Open Access"",""Scopus"",""2-s2.0-80052521877""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The paper presents findings, obtained from qualitative focus groups and interviews with local citizens in three wind energy projects. The analysis shows that the local citizens were ambivalent about the scheme. The community projects generally were perceived positively, but a number of critical reactions to the scheme were also identified. The categories into which local concerns fell were: bribery, legitimacy and administration of the schemes. A key finding was that some local citizens dismissed the scheme as inappropriate to address and redress the adverse impacts related to the wind project. Overall, the many challenges identified indicate that the Danish scheme failed to boost local acceptance. It was also evident from the Danish experience that a regulatory framework does not in itself address key concerns such as bribery as has been suggested in the literature on non-regulatory developer-led schemes in the UK. The findings raise questions about the effectiveness of community benefits as compensation tools aiming to promote local acceptance.

However, due to intermittent wind speeds, the energy generated cannot be scheduled as consistently as conventional fuel sources, impacting power system security and stability. Developing wind energy that internalises intermittency could provide positive public impacts in the form of reduced emissions, increased renewable energy capacity and energy security but can also have negative impacts in the form of increased costs, visual disamenities, environmental impacts and reduced autarky, amongst others. Few studies elicit public preferences for the development of wind energy that takes account of intermittency. Using focus groups and a discrete choice experiment involving four latent classes as part of a national survey of 1107 members of the public in Ireland, we evaluate public preferences for wind energy development that mitigates wind energy variability through electricity trade, battery storage, and demand side management. We observe substantial heterogeneity with respect to preferences for wind energy development with intermittency solutions. Approximately 62 % of the sample derive positive utility from all solutions, appear unconcerned about the potential negative impacts of renewable energy infrastructure and display pro-wind energy sentiment.

Research on the spatial differentiation of wind energy developments at the regional level is still insufficient, however. This study provides new empirical evidence for the extent to which regional differences in the deployment of wind energy are related to specific environmental and socioeconomic factors, by a statistical analysis of data for districts in the Czech Republic. Unlike previous studies, we found that the installed capacity of wind energy cannot be well predicted by wind potential, land area and population density in an area. In the Czech Republic, wind farms more likely have been implemented in more urbanised, environmentally deprived coal-mining areas that are affected by economic depression. It seems that in environmentally deprived areas, wind energy is more positively accepted as an alternative source to coal, and the economic motivation (financial benefits for municipalities) can have a greater effect on local acceptance, while public opposition is less efficient due to lower social capital and involvement in political matters.

A large body of evidence shows that local populations want to be involved and respected for their concerns, but in practice, this is a complex process that cannot be solved with simple measures, such as financial compensation. The visual presence and the acoustic impact of a wind farm is an important concern for residents. Generally, environmental noise management aims to reduce the exposure of the population, usually based on acoustics and restricted to a limited number of sources (such as transportation or industry) and sound descriptors (such as Lden). Individual perceptions are taken into account only at an aggregate, statistical level (such as percentage of exposed, annoyed or sleep-disturbed persons in the population). Individual perceptions and reactions to sound vary in intensity and over different dimensions (such as pleasure/fear or distraction). Sound level is a predictor of the perceived health effects of sound, but explains only part of the reaction. The positive or negative perception of and attitude to the source of the sound is a better predictor of its effects. This article aims to show how the two perspectives (based on acoustics and on perception) can lead to a combined approach in the management of a wind farm aimed to reduce annoyance, not only on a sound level. An important aspect in this approach is what the sound means to people, leading to the following questions: is it associated with the experience of having no say in plans, does it lead to anxiety or worry and is it appropriate?

Grassroots-initiated wind energy schemes as a form of rural enterprise have received less attention, especially in the Irish context. Using a case study approach, this paper analyses the challenges and opportunities faced in progressing community wind energy projects in rural Ireland. Such an analysis is especially relevant given Ireland's commitment to developing a fair and sustainable society as advocated in its Sustainable Development Framework. With the decline of agriculture and considerable outmigration from rural areas, wind energy represents an opportunity to revitalize rural economies. More generally, as opposition to wind turbines and associated infrastructure is common in Ireland, it is clear that the relevant authorities must engage local stakeholders more meaningfully in the planning and development process. In this vein, community energy initiatives have the potential to boost rural economies, enhance acceptance, and develop knowledge networks at the local level. Drawing lessons from a community wind energy case study, it is argued that community projects can be nurtured in Ireland by (i) engaging communities, especially weak stakeholders, in both agenda setting and the planning and development process for individual projects, and (ii) ensuring that technical and financial support is available to communities, while (iii) being careful to apply the 'community' label only to initiatives that can meet the expectations of such a project. © Oxford University Press and Community Development Journal. 2017 All rights reserved."","""",""Ireland"; alternative energy; community resource management; development project; energy planning; grassroots level; infrastructural development; rural energy; stakeholder; sustainable development; wind power;" wind turbine"",""Article"",""Final"",""All Open Access";" Green Open Access"",""Scopus"",""2-s2.0-85047949202""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This is particularly relevant for reusable launchers, which are aimed at maximising operational availability and payload capacity. Yet, despite various load relief advances in the aeronautics and wind energy sectors, classical feedback-only techniques remain the state-of-practice for launchers. In this article, an improved load relief functionality for reusable vehicles is proposed based on the use of a disturbance observer for on-board wind anticipation and a load relief compensator driven by the estimate of the wind for its amelioration. Two space systems are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed approach. First, it is applied to a 3 degrees-of-freedom nonlinear simulation model of DLR's EAGLE vertical-flight demonstrator. Then, it is applied to a 6 degrees-of-freedom nonlinear simulation model of a generic lightweight, reusable launch vehicle. For both cases, the results highlight the benefits of using this type of wind-estimation/load-relief compensation schemes. Further, for the second case, which uses thrust vector control and planar fins for ascent and descent attitude control, it is also shown that the use of fins during ascent (which is not common practice), can further improve launcher performance. © 2021 IAA"",""Disturbance observer"; Launch vehicles; Robust control;" Wind rejection"",""Attitude control"; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Disturbance rejection; Fins (heat exchange); Flight simulators; Launch vehicles; Launching; Reusability; Reusable rockets; Wind power; Disturbance observer; Flight control design; Nonlinear simulations; Operational availability; Pay load capacity; Performance; Reusable launchers; Simulation model; Wind disturbance; Wind rejection;" Robust control"",""Article"",""Final"","""",""Scopus"",""2-s2.0-85108787784""";;;;;;;;;;;;;
